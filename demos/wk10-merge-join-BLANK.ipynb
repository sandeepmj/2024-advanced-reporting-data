    "Most businesses, government agencies and research institutes do not put their large and complex data directly into ```Excel``` or ```CSV``` files. Instead, they use ```Relational Databases``` which is considered more efficient, secure and easier to manage for a host of reasons. For example, a table uses less space to list gender as 1 for male, 2 for female, etc. A related \"lookup table\" defines the values for the genders.\n",
